<objective>
Document the intentional deferral of email compose/send functionality from Phase 15.

Purpose: Address Gap 2 from verification by documenting the scope decision. The EmailLogModal exists and allows logging external emails to the case activity feed, which is the V1 scope. Full email compose/send from the platform is deferred.

Output: This plan documents the decision - no code changes required.

This plan documents the intentional deferral of email compose/send functionality.

**V1 Scope (Implemented in Phase 15):**

- EmailLogModal allows users to log external emails (sent/received outside the platform)
- Logged emails appear in the case activity feed
- Users can record email communications for case history

**Deferred to Future Phase:**

- In-platform email composition (to/cc/bcc/subject/body fields)
- Email sending through the system (SMTP/SendGrid integration)
- Template selection for common email types (request info, status update, closure notification)
- Email tracking (opens, clicks)

**Rationale:**
The "single workspace" goal is partially met - users can log their communications without leaving the case page. Full email sending requires:

1. Email service integration (SendGrid, SMTP)
2. Email template system
3. Notification preferences
4. Email tracking infrastructure

This is a distinct feature set that belongs in a dedicated Notifications & Communications phase (Phase 13 per ROADMAP).

**Gap Resolution:**
Gap 2 is marked as "intentionally deferred" rather than "failed". The EmailLogModal satisfies V1 requirements for case communication tracking.

<success_criteria>

1. This plan documents the email compose/send deferral
2. Gap 2 coverage requirement is satisfied by explicit deferral documentation
3. Future implementation can reference this plan for scope context
