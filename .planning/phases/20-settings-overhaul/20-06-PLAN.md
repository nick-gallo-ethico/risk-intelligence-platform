# Plan 20-06: Settings Navigation Polish & Verification

## Objective

Polish the settings navigation, ensure all links work, update sidebar, and verify all 12 success criteria.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Settings Sidebar Navigation

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/settings/layout.tsx`

Create a settings layout with left sidebar navigation (HubSpot pattern):

- Settings pages share a left sidebar with section headers and links
- Sections: Your Preferences, Account Management, Data Management, Tools
- Current page highlighted
- Sidebar collapses on mobile (responsive)

This wraps all `/settings/*` pages in a consistent layout.

### Task 2: Update Admin Navigation

**File:** `apps/frontend/src/lib/navigation.ts`

Simplify admin nav to point to settings hub:

- Keep "Settings" as primary link to `/settings`
- Remove individual links that are now accessible through settings hub (keep Workflows since it's high-traffic)
- Keep Audit Log as it's frequently accessed

### Task 3: Verify All Routes Work

Manually verify each settings route resolves:

- `/settings` — hub page
- `/settings/profile` — user profile
- `/settings/notifications` — notification preferences
- `/settings/organization` — org settings (existing)
- `/settings/defaults` — account defaults
- `/settings/users` — user management (existing)
- `/settings/roles` — roles & permissions
- `/settings/audit` — audit log (existing)
- `/settings/integrations` — integrations
- `/settings/approvals` — approval config
- `/settings/ai` — AI settings
- `/settings/properties` — custom properties
- `/settings/objects` — objects browser
- `/settings/workflows` — workflow builder (existing)

### Task 4: TypeScript Compilation Check

Run `npx tsc --noEmit` on the frontend to verify all new pages compile.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Settings layout with sidebar navigation works
- [ ] All 14 settings routes resolve without 404
- [ ] Admin nav simplified and consistent
- [ ] Mobile responsive sidebar
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
