<objective>
Create an execution notes document that clarifies the overlap between Phase 15's completed work and Phase 16 plans 01-06. This prevents executors from being confused by plans that instruct them to create components that already exist.

Purpose: Plans 02, 03, and 06 were created before Phase 15 completed and contain outdated instructions. This plan documents exactly what should be skipped, modified, or executed as-is.
Output: 16-EXECUTION-NOTES.md with clear guidance for each plan.

  <name>Task 1: Verify Phase 15 artifacts to confirm overlap claims</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Before creating the execution notes, verify that Phase 15 actually built what we claim it built. Run these verification commands:

1. **Verify ai-chat-panel.tsx exists and is substantial**:

```bash
wc -l apps/frontend/src/components/cases/ai-chat-panel.tsx
# Expected: ~600+ lines
```

2. **Verify socket.io-client is installed**:

```bash
grep "socket.io-client" apps/frontend/package.json
# Expected: Match found with version
```

3. **Verify case detail page imports AiChatPanel**:

```bash
grep -n "AiChatPanel" apps/frontend/src/app/\(authenticated\)/cases/\[id\]/page.tsx
# Expected: Import and usage found
```

4. **Verify WebSocket event handling exists**:

```bash
grep -E "text_delta|message_complete|action_executed" apps/frontend/src/components/cases/ai-chat-panel.tsx
# Expected: Multiple matches for event handlers
```

5. **Verify Plan 16-02 artifacts do NOT need to be created** (because Phase 15 built them differently):

```bash
# Check if useAiChat.ts exists (16-02 Task 2 would create this)
ls apps/frontend/src/hooks/useAiChat.ts 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND - Phase 15 used different approach"

# Check if ai-panel-context.tsx exists (16-02 Task 1 would modify this)
ls apps/frontend/src/contexts/ai-panel-context.tsx 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND - Phase 15 used different approach"
```

6. **Verify Plan 16-03 artifacts do NOT need to be created**:

```bash
# Check if useAiSocket.ts exists
ls apps/frontend/src/hooks/useAiSocket.ts 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND - Phase 15 embedded socket directly in component"

# Check if ai-socket-provider.tsx exists
ls apps/frontend/src/providers/ai-socket-provider.tsx 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT FOUND - Phase 15 used module-level singleton"
```

Document the results. If any verification fails, adjust the execution notes accordingly.

# Phase 16 Execution Notes

## Critical: Phase 15 Overlap

Phase 15 (Case Detail Page Overhaul) was completed AFTER plans 16-01 through 16-06 were created. This means several plans contain instructions that overlap with or duplicate work already done in Phase 15.

**Phase 15 Built:**

1. `apps/frontend/src/components/cases/ai-chat-panel.tsx` (638 lines) - Complete WebSocket streaming chat
2. `socket.io-client` installed in `apps/frontend/package.json`
3. Case detail page (`apps/frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/cases/[id]/page.tsx`) has:
   - AI button in action row that opens Sheet overlay
   - `<AiChatPanel entityType="case" entityId={caseData.id} />`
   - `onActionComplete={fetchCase}` for refreshing after AI actions
4. WebSocket events working: text_delta, message_complete, tool_use, action_executed, error, stop
5. AI actions verified: change-status and add-case-note work with Zod 4.x compatibility fix

## Dependency Chain Guidance

**IMPORTANT: When a plan is SKIPPED, its downstream dependencies are AUTO-SATISFIED.**

Plans 16-02 and 16-03 describe creating artifacts that Phase 15 already built (using a different architecture). Since Phase 15 is complete:

- Plan 16-04 has `depends_on: [16-02]` in its frontmatter
- Plan 16-02 is SKIPPED (Phase 15 built the equivalent)
- Therefore, 16-04's dependency is **satisfied by Phase 15**, not by executing 16-02

This means:

- Plan 16-04 can execute immediately (Wave 1)
- Plan 16-05 can execute immediately (Wave 1)
- Plan 16-08 depends only on **actually-executed plans**: [16-01]

The frontmatter in 16-04, 16-05, 16-06 was written before Phase 15. Treat their `depends_on` as satisfied if the referenced plan is SKIPPED.

---

## Plan-by-Plan Execution Guidance

### 16-01: Backend REST chat endpoint + auth guard + context-loader fallback

**Status: EXECUTE AS-IS**

This plan adds backend robustness that Phase 15 did not cover:

- REST fallback endpoint (POST /ai/chat)
- OptionalJwtAuthGuard for graceful auth handling
- ContextLoaderService fallback for missing org/user

Execute all tasks as written.

---

### 16-02: AI panel context + useAiChat hook + rewrite ai-panel.tsx

**Status: SKIP ENTIRELY**

Phase 15 already built `ai-chat-panel.tsx` with:

- WebSocket streaming chat (more advanced than the REST-based useAiChat this plan creates)
- Entity context passed as props (entityType, entityId)
- Conversation history loading
- Connection status indicators
- Suggested prompts

DO NOT execute this plan. The Phase 15 implementation is superior and already integrated.

---

### 16-03: Install socket.io-client + useAiSocket + AiSocketProvider + useAiStreamingChat

**Status: SKIP ENTIRELY**

Phase 15 already:

- Installed `socket.io-client`
- Implemented WebSocket connection directly in `ai-chat-panel.tsx` with a module-level singleton pattern
- Handles text_delta, message_complete, tool_use, action_executed, error events

DO NOT execute this plan. The Phase 15 implementation is complete.

---

### 16-04: AI skill components (summarize, category-suggest, risk-score)

**Status: EXECUTE AS-IS**

This plan creates frontend components for AI skills that Phase 15 did not build:

- `useAiSkills` generic hook
- `AiSummaryButton` component
- `AiCategorySuggest` component
- `AiRiskScore` component

These are additive and do not conflict with Phase 15 work. Execute all tasks.

**Dependency note:** Plan lists `depends_on: [16-02]`, but 16-02 is SKIPPED. The dependency is satisfied by Phase 15's equivalent work. Execute this plan in Wave 1.

---

### 16-05: AI action preview components + useAiActions hook

**Status: PARTIAL EXECUTION**

Phase 15 built action execution but not the preview-then-execute pattern UI.

Execute:

- Task 1: Create useAiActions hook (preview, execute, undo, listActions)
- Task 2: Create AiActionPreview dialog component

Skip:

- Task 3: "Integrate action capabilities into AI panel" - ai-chat-panel.tsx has a different architecture. Actions are executed via WebSocket events, not via REST preview/execute flow. Integration would require refactoring the existing component.

---

### 16-06: Health check + case detail wiring + graceful degradation + AiSocketProvider

**Status: PARTIAL EXECUTION**

Execute:

- Task 1: Add AI health check endpoint (GET /api/v1/ai/health) - still needed

Skip:

- Task 2: Wire AI button on case detail page - ALREADY DONE in Phase 15
- Task 3: Add graceful degradation to AI panel - ai-chat-panel.tsx already handles connection errors
- Task 4: Add AiSocketProvider to app layout - Phase 15 uses a different pattern (module-level singleton)

## Summary

| Plan  | Status  | Reason                                                        |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 16-01 | EXECUTE | Backend robustness not covered by Phase 15                    |
| 16-02 | SKIP    | Phase 15 built ai-chat-panel.tsx                              |
| 16-03 | SKIP    | Phase 15 installed socket.io-client and implemented WebSocket |
| 16-04 | EXECUTE | Skill components are additive                                 |
| 16-05 | PARTIAL | Create hook/dialog, skip integration task                     |
| 16-06 | PARTIAL | Only health check endpoint needed                             |

## Recommended Execution Order

1. Execute 16-01 (Wave 1 - backend)
2. Execute 16-04 (Wave 1 - skill components, dependency satisfied by Phase 15)
3. Execute 16-05 Tasks 1-2 only (Wave 1 - action components)
4. Execute 16-06 Task 1 only (Wave 1 - health check)
5. Execute 16-08 (verification - see Plan 16-08)
