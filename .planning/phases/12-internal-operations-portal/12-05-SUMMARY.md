phase: 12-internal-operations-portal

## One-liner

Three-tier go-live readiness system with hard gates, weighted readiness items, and client sign-off for below-threshold launches.

## What Was Built

### Types and Constants (`types/go-live.types.ts`)
- `HARD_GATES` - 4 blocking requirements per CONTEXT.md:
  - `auth_configured` - Authentication configured
  - `admin_trained` - At least 1 admin trained/certified
  - `terms_signed` - Terms & data processing agreement signed
  - `contact_designated` - Primary contact designated
- `READINESS_ITEMS` - 7 weighted checklist items (sum to 100):
  - `data_migration` (20) - Historical data imported
  - `test_workflow` (15) - End-to-end testing
  - `users_invited` (15) - User accounts created
  - `branding_configured` (10) - Logo and colors
  - `categories_configured` (10) - Category taxonomy
  - `integrations_tested` (15) - HRIS/SSO verified
  - `first_policy` (15) - At least one policy live
- `RECOMMENDED_SCORE = 85` - Minimum readiness threshold
- `GateStatus` enum: PENDING, PASSED, FAILED, WAIVED
- `SignoffType` enum: CLIENT, INTERNAL
- `HardGateId` and `ReadinessItemId` types
- `GoLiveReadinessResult` interface for calculation results

### Prisma Models
- `GoLiveGate` - Hard gate status per project with waiver support
- `ReadinessItem` - Weighted checklist with partial credit (0-100%)
- `GoLiveSignoff` - Client/internal approval for below-threshold launches
- Relations added to `ImplementationProject`

### TypeScript Entity Interfaces
- `go-live-gate.entity.ts` - Interface with DTOs
- `readiness-item.entity.ts` - Interface with `ReadinessSummary`
- `go-live-signoff.entity.ts` - Interface with signature tracking

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Hard gates must pass OR be waived with approval | Security - can't bypass auth, training, legal |
| Readiness score is weighted sum | Some items more critical (data migration 20%) |
| Unique constraint on (projectId, gateId/itemId) | One status per gate/item per project |
| percentComplete field on ReadinessItem | Supports partial credit for in-progress items |
| Sign-off captures scores at signing time | Immutable audit trail of what was acknowledged |
| acknowledgedRisks as array | Explicit tracking of each risk client accepts |

## Architecture

│   └── ... (total 100%)
└── GoLiveSignoff? (if launching below threshold)

## Database Tables Created

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `go_live_gates` | Hard gate status per project |
| `readiness_items` | Weighted checklist items |
| `go_live_signoffs` | Client acknowledgment records |

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `types/go-live.types.ts` | Created - gate/item definitions |
| `types/index.ts` | Updated - export go-live types |
| `entities/go-live-gate.entity.ts` | Created - TypeScript interface |
| `entities/readiness-item.entity.ts` | Created - TypeScript interface |
| `entities/go-live-signoff.entity.ts` | Created - TypeScript interface |
| `entities/index.ts` | Created - export all entities |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Updated - 3 models, 2 enums, relations |

## Commits

| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| 3a201e8 | feat(12-05): add go-live types and gate definitions |
| 2ded64a | feat(12-05): add GoLiveGate and ReadinessItem Prisma models |
| 4d51b47 | feat(12-05): add GoLiveSignoff Prisma model |

## Verification

- [x] Prisma schema validates
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] Tables created in database (go_live_gates, readiness_items, go_live_signoffs)
- [x] Lint passes (0 errors)
- [x] HARD_GATES has 4 blocking gates
- [x] READINESS_ITEMS sum to 100 weight
- [x] RECOMMENDED_SCORE is 85

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Next Steps

- 12-06: Go-Live Readiness Service (calculate score, check gates)
- 12-07: Go-Live Readiness Controller (API endpoints)
- Future: Client-visible progress portal

## Duration

~18 minutes
