Phase 6 (Case Management) execution in progress. Waves 1-3 complete. Ready to start Wave 4.

**Wave 4 plans (06-12, 06-13, 06-14)** are frontend work:
- 06-12: Case list page with advanced filtering and saved views
- 06-13: Case detail page with linked RIUs and tabs
- 06-14: Investigation detail page with checklist panel

**Wave 5 plans (06-15, 06-16)** follow:
- 06-15: Keyboard shortcuts and command palette
- 06-16: Final integration (has checkpoint - `autonomous: false`)

After all plans complete, verifier runs to check phase goal achievement.

<decisions_made>

This session added these decisions to STATE.md:
- 06-06: TemplateRequirement enum: REQUIRED, RECOMMENDED, OPTIONAL
- 06-06: Parent category inheritance for template recommendations
- 06-07: Progress percentage calculation excludes skipped items
- 06-07: Required items cannot be skipped
- 06-08: Processor in remediation module (domain co-location)
- 06-09: Chinese Wall pattern for reporter identity protection
- 06-10: Parallel search execution in UnifiedSearchService
- 06-10: Dynamic ES mapping for custom fields
- 06-11: ENTITY_RELATIONSHIPS for related entity configuration
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - clean execution so far.

<context>
Executing Phase 6 with `/gsd:execute-phase 6` orchestrator. Using quality model profile (opus for executors, sonnet for verifier).

Wave-based parallel execution pattern:
1. Wave 4 has 3 frontend plans (06-12, 06-13, 06-14) - can run in parallel
2. Wave 5 has 2 plans - 06-15 depends on 06-12-14, 06-16 is checkpoint (autonomous: false)
3. Plan 06-16 will pause for human verification of E2E flows

All backend infrastructure for Case Management is now complete. Frontend pages will consume the APIs built in earlier waves.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:execute-phase 6`

This will:
1. Detect SUMMARYs for 06-01 through 06-11 exist
2. Skip to Wave 4 (06-12, 06-13, 06-14)
3. Spawn 3 parallel executors for frontend pages
4. Continue to Wave 5 after completion
5. Handle checkpoint in 06-16
6. Run verifier after all plans
</next_action>
