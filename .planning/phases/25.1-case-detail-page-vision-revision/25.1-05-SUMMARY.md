# Phase 25.1 Plan 05: Overview Tab Rebuild Summary

**Rebuilt Overview tab with 6 HubSpot-style sections (Data Highlights, Editable Summary with AI, Collapsible Details, Status History Timeline, Recent Activities, Upcoming Tasks) and wired PipelineStageBar above tab bar**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-13T18:44:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-13T19:09:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments

- DataHighlightsCard displays 6 key values (severity, status, age, SLA, assignee, source) in 3x2 grid
- EditableSummary with inline edit mode and AI generate button
- StatusHistoryTimeline shows vertical timeline with colored dots, dates, users, rationale
- Overview tab rebuilt with 6 sections as default landing tab
- PipelineStageBar wired above tabs in center column
- Case Details section is collapsible, collapsed by default
- Recent Activities shows 3 most recent with "View all" link to Activities tab
- Upcoming Tasks shows 3 items with checkboxes

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create DataHighlightsCard, EditableSummary, StatusHistoryTimeline** - `384d246` (previously committed as part of 25.1-03)
   - Note: These components were created in a prior plan execution
2. **Task 2: Rebuild Overview tab and wire PipelineStageBar** - `a152a41` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `apps/frontend/src/components/record-detail/DataHighlightsCard.tsx` - 6-value grid with badge/text/sla/user support
- `apps/frontend/src/components/record-detail/EditableSummary.tsx` - Inline edit with AI generation
- `apps/frontend/src/components/record-detail/StatusHistoryTimeline.tsx` - Vertical timeline with colored dots
- `apps/frontend/src/components/cases/case-tabs.tsx` - Rebuilt OverviewTab with 6 sections
- `apps/frontend/src/app/(authenticated)/cases/[id]/page.tsx` - Wired PipelineStageBar above tabs

## Decisions Made

- Overview tab set as default (changed from Activities)
- Removed URL state syncing for tabs (local state only)
- Pipeline visualization removed from Overview content, now only in PipelineStageBar
- Status history populated from activities filtered by status_changed action type
- Tasks section uses mock data pending actual tasks API endpoint
- Case Details section collapsed by default to reduce initial cognitive load

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

Note: Task 1 components (DataHighlightsCard, EditableSummary, StatusHistoryTimeline) were found to be already committed from a previous plan execution (commit 384d246). This is expected as Plan 05 depends on Plan 01 and Plan 02 which may have included these components.

## Issues Encountered

- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in case-investigations-panel.tsx (unrelated to this plan) - not addressed as out of scope
- Task 1 components already existed from prior execution - verified they met requirements and continued

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Overview tab fully functional with all 6 sections
- PipelineStageBar operational above tabs
- Ready for Plan 06 (left sidebar property cards)
- Mock tasks data should be replaced when tasks API endpoint is available
