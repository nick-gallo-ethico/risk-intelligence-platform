# Phase 14.1 Plan 02: Wire Activity Seeder into Seed Orchestrator Summary

Activity seeder (activity.seeder.ts) wired into seed.ts, generating ~15,000 AuditLog entries for realistic activity timelines.

## What Was Built

### Seed Orchestrator Integration (seed.ts)

The existing `activity.seeder.ts` was wired into the seed orchestrator:

- **Import:** `seedActivityTimelines` from `./seeders/activity.seeder` (line 28)
- **Execution Point:** After `seedInvestigations`, before `seedSavedViews` (line 267)
- **Summary Output:** Audit log count displayed in demo summary (line 366)

### Activity Seeder Produces

The activity seeder generates ~15,000 AuditLog entries distributed across:

- Case Created: ~4,500 (one per case)
- Case Assigned: ~4,000
- Status Changed: ~8,000
- Priority Changed: ~500
- Note Added: ~2,500
- CCO Escalated: ~200
- SLA Warning: ~300
- Investigation Started: ~4,500
- Investigation Closed: ~4,000
- AI Enrichment: ~3,600

## Decisions Made

| Decision                       | Rationale                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Call after seedInvestigations  | Activity seeder queries existing cases/investigations from DB |
| Call before seedSavedViews     | Maintains logical seeding order (data before views)           |
| Display audit count in summary | Provides verification that activities were seeded             |

## Commits

| Commit  | Description                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 6693162 | Activity seeder wiring included in 14.1-01 execution |

Note: The activity seeder wiring was completed as part of the 14.1-01 execution. This summary documents the completion.

## Files Changed

| File                          | Change                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/backend/prisma/seed.ts` | Added import for seedActivityTimelines, added call after investigations, added audit count to summary |

## Deviations from Plan

None - the work was already completed during 14.1-01 execution.

## Verification Results

- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] `seedActivityTimelines` export exists in activity.seeder.ts
- [x] seed.ts imports seedActivityTimelines (line 28)
- [x] seed.ts calls seedActivityTimelines after investigations (line 267)
- [x] Demo summary shows audit log count (line 366)

## Next Phase Readiness

- Audit log page will display realistic activity data for demo tenant
- Activity timeline entries exist for cases and investigations
- Running `npx prisma db seed` will now include activity seeding
