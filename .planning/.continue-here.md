<current_state>
We were in the middle of `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` when user paused. The discussion shifted to project alignment because user was concerned I didn't fully understand the platform.

**Key realization:** The user said "I have more context to add" just before pausing. There is additional context they want to share before we proceed with Phase 1 planning.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- GSD project initialized with ROADMAP.md (7 phases, 73 requirements)
- PROJECT.md created and UPDATED with complete platform understanding
- Identified 6 platform interfaces (was incorrectly showing 2):
  - Client Platform (primary customer)
  - Employee Portal (authenticated self-service)
  - Ethics Portal (anonymous reporting)
  - Operator Console (Ethico hotline staff)
  - Implementation Portal (Ethico onboarding - v2.0)
  - Demo Environment (sales demos - v2.0)
- Documented all user categories and roles from PRDs
- Committed updated PROJECT.md
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- **IMMEDIATE:** User has more context to add - ask what's missing
- Then: Complete Phase 1 gray area discussion
- Then: Create CONTEXT.md for Phase 1
- Then: /gsd:plan-phase 1
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Implementation Portal deferred to v2.0 (focus v1.0 on core workflows)
- Demo Environment deferred to v2.0 (sales can use test tenants initially)
- Primary customer is client compliance teams, not Ethico staff
- Ethico operates the hotline service as a managed service for clients
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - user paused session, not blocked

<context>
The user was rightfully concerned that the original PROJECT.md framed this as "two products" when it's actually a more complex platform serving multiple user populations. The PRDs (especially UI-UX-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md and PROFESSIONAL-SERVICES-SPEC.md) document this fully, but I had missed it in initial extraction.

Key PRD files referenced:
- `00-PLATFORM/UI-UX-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` - Section 2 has complete user taxonomy
- `00-PLATFORM/PROFESSIONAL-SERVICES-SPEC.md` - Section 3-4 has Implementation Portal details
- `00-PLATFORM/01-PLATFORM-VISION.md` - Core entity model and architecture

User said "I have more context to add" right before pausing. Start by asking what else they want to share.
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming:
1. Ask user: "You mentioned having more context to add. What else should I know?"
2. Update PROJECT.md if needed based on their response
3. Then proceed with `/gsd:discuss-phase 1` gray areas
</next_action>

<session_management_note>
This session covered a lot of ground. Consider starting fresh for Phase 1 planning after the user shares their additional context. The updated PROJECT.md captures the current understanding.
