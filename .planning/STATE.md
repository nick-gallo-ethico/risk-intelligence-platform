### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Demo tenant (Phase 2) built early to serve as continuous test bed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

- Q1 deadline pressure may require scope adjustment - monitor velocity after Phase 1
- Anthropic BAA for healthcare needs verification before Phase 5 AI integration
- Existing codebase (~15%) needs integration verification during Phase 1
